       " Document(page_content='A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT\\nOur Common Purpose: Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st Century,  \\na report of the American Academy’s Commission on the Practice of \\nDemocratic Citizenship, comes at a pivotal moment in the history of the \\nAmerican experiment. \\nAs this report goes to press, our nation, already challenged by shifting political, economic, and \\nsocial forces, is also in the early days of a serious public health and economic crisis. While it is \\nimpossible to predict today how the COVID -19 epidemic will impact the fabric of the United States \\nand the world, the work done by the Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship does \\nallow one confident prediction: Americans will respond to the current challenge and its aftereffects \\nwith creative acts of generosity and innovative solutions borne of the recognition that we are all in \\nthis together. In the pages that follow, you will find this spirit expressed in Americans’ own words. \\nNever before has the work of the Academy reflected the voices and experiences of such a broad and \\ndiverse group of Americans. In 2019, the Commission conducted forty-seven listening sessions in \\ncities and towns around the country and solicited the stories and experiences with the democratic \\nprocess of hundreds of Americans from different demographic and political backgrounds (for a full \\nlist, see Appendix B). Their wisdom and commitment not only inspired the Commission’s final rec-\\nommendations but also demonstrate the potential for what the United States can become when all \\nof its citizens are actively engaged in the civic and political life of their communities and the nation.\\nThroughout our country’s history, the American people have confronted moments of crisis with \\nresilience and an openness to reinvention, enabling our nation to become a better version of it-\\nself. Even before the COVID -19 pandemic, the members of this Commission recognized that we \\nfound ourselves at a similar crossroads. The recommendations in this report touch all sectors of \\nAmerican life and offer a bold path that will require all of us to commit to reinventing aspects of \\nour constitutional democracy. The realities of a disruptive media and information environment, \\noutdated political institutions, economic and social inequality, and hyperpartisan political lead-\\nership have laid bare the urgency of this imperative. The Commission challenges us to achieve \\nsignificant progress toward its recommendations by 2026, our nation’s 250th anniversary. \\nThe Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship was established in the spring of \\n2018 at the initiative of then Academy President Jonathan Fanton and Stephen D. Bechtel, Jr., \\nChair of the S. D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation. Mr. Bechtel challenged the Academy to consider what \\nit means to be a good citizen in the twenty-first century, and to ask how all of us might obtain \\nthe values, knowledge, and skills to become still better citizens. Since 1780, projects that work \\nto bolster American citizens’ understanding of and engagement with the institutions of their \\ngovernment have been a hallmark of the Academy’s work. Our charter states that the Arts and \\nSciences “promote the honor and dignity of the government which patronizes them, ” and that the \\niv OUR COMMON PURPOSE', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION\\nFounded nearly 250 years ago, the United States \\nof America is the world’s oldest constitution-\\nal democracy. Its infancy, under the Articles of \\nConfederation, was turbulent. Its early prospects, at \\nthe Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, were \\nvery much uncertain. At the Convention, Benjamin \\nFranklin—catalyst of the Revolution, leading citizen \\nof the republic, enslaver turned abolitionist—won-\\ndered as he observed the conflicts, compromises, and \\ncontradictions of the process: was the young nation’s \\nsun rising or setting? With the signing of the Consti-\\ntution, he concluded, the sun was rising.\\nToday, the question of rise or fall is more pertinent than ever. In \\nthis age of globalization, centralized power, economic inequal-\\nity, deep demographic shifts, political polarization, pandemics \\nand climate change, and radical disruption in the media and \\ninformation environments, we face these converging trends in \\na constitutional democracy that feels to many increasingly un-\\nresponsive, nonadaptive, and even antiquated.\\nConsider the data. The public’s approval rate for Congress—our \\nnational legislature and the first branch of government estab-\\nlished in the Constitution, charged with articulating the will of \\nthe people—hit a historic low of 9 percent in 2013.1 Now rates \\nhover around a still-meager 25 percent. Income and wealth \\ninequality levels have exceeded those on the eve of the Great \\nDepression. Social mobility has stagnated. Inequities contin-\\nue to track lines of race, gender, and ethnicity, revealing deep \\nREINVENTING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY  1', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='structural unfairness in our society. A surge \\nin white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and anti- \\nimmigrant vitriol has flooded our politics \\nwith sentiments corrosive to the ethic of a \\ndemocratic society, while people of color \\ncontinue to confront barriers to opportunity \\nand participation. At all levels of our system, \\nvoter turnout remains low in comparison to \\nother advanced democracies. Trust in institu-\\ntions has collapsed while an online culture of \\ngleeful, nihilistic cynicism thrives. Fewer than \\none-third of Millennials consider it essential \\nto live in a democracy.2 Partisan rancor has \\nnot reached the intensity of Civil War–era \\nAmerica—but it is nonetheless very high. \\nWhen Americans are asked what unites us \\nacross our differences, the increasingly com-\\nmon answer is nothing . \\nY et this is not the whole story. It is not even \\nthe decisive chapter. As we have traveled the \\nUnited States in recent months and listened \\nto Americans from many walks of life, we \\nhave heard disappointment and frustration, \\nbut even more, we heard a yearning to believe \\nagain in the American story, to feel connect-\\ned to one another. We heard stories of surging \\nparticipation and innovation, of communi-\\nties working to build new connections across \\nlong-standing divides, and of individual citi-\\nzens suddenly awakening to the potential of \\ntheir democratic responsibilities. Even as we \\nsurvey the impact of COVID -19, we see incred-\\nible individual and collective efforts to sustain \\ncivic resilience. That is why we have come to \\nbelieve a reinvention of our constitutional de-\\nmocracy remains entirely within reach—and \\nurgently needed. After all, a superlative ben-\\nefit of constitutional democracy, as articulat-\\ned in both the Declaration of Independence \\nand the Constitution, is that it is adaptable to \\nnew circumstances and unanticipated chal-\\nlenges. This report, Our Common Purpose: Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st \\nCentury , lays out a case for renewed civic faith. \\nIt offers a set of recommendations for build-\\ning a fresh collective commitment to demo-\\ncratic citizenship, to American constitutional \\ndemocracy, and to one another. Our theory \\nof action is the idea that improvement of our \\ncivic culture and of our institutions must go \\nhand in hand. Each is necessary; neither on its \\nown is sufficient. \\nOur conversations about democratic civic life \\nare now so polarized that we must pause to \\ndefine our central terms. In the twenty-first \\ncentury, democracy  refers to a political system \\nin which legislative and chief executive deci-\\nsion-makers are elected by majority or plu-\\nrality rule by eligible voters, with a presump-\\ntion that the franchise approaches universal \\nadult suffrage among legal citizens and that \\nmechanisms are in place to protect ideologi-\\ncal, religious, ethnic, and other demographic \\nminorities. This definition refers to represen-\\ntative rather than direct democracy, reflect-\\ning that all existing democratic societies are INTRODUCTION\\nA superlative benefit of \\nconstitutional democracy, \\nas articulated in both the \\nDeclaration of Indepen-\\ndence and the Constitu-\\ntion, is that it is adaptable \\nto new circumstances and \\nunanticipated challenges.\\n2 OUR COMMON PURPOSE', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='representative. While we use both constitu -\\ntional democracy  and democracy  in this re-\\nport, we recognize these as synonyms to other \\nterms in common usage in the United States, \\nincluding “republic” and “democratic repub-\\nlic” (see Appendix A for more key terms). In \\ntraditions of American political thought, all \\nthese terms capture forms of rights-based \\nrepresentative government in which 1) elect-\\ned government leadership is constrained by \\nconstitutionalism, the rule of law, the sepa-\\nration of powers, the free expression of the \\npeople, and the legal protection and moral \\naffirmation of the rights of individuals; and \\n2) groups and parties that are not part of \\nelectoral majorities cannot easily be disen-\\nfranchised or suffer loss of rights. We do not \\nnaively claim that more democracy simply in \\nthe form of more participation will solve our \\nproblems. We seek instead to achieve healthy \\nconnections between robust participation \\nand political institutions worthy of participa-\\ntion. The beauty of constitutional democracy \\nis that winners of an election are confined by \\nthe Constitution, a separation of powers, and \\na genuine institutionalized distrust of power, \\nall democratically established. \\nConsequently, a healthy constitutional democ-\\nracy depends on a virtuous cycle in which re-\\nsponsive political institutions foster a healthy \\ncivic culture of participation and responsibil-\\nity, while a healthy civic culture—a combina-\\ntion of values, norms, and narratives—keeps \\nour political institutions responsive and inclu-\\nsive. Institutions and culture intersect in the \\nrealm of civil society: the ecosystem of asso-\\nciations and groups in which people practice \\nhabits of participation and self-rule and rein-\\nforce norms of mutual obligation. Through-\\nout our proceedings and in this report, we \\nuse a meaning of citizenship that extends be-\\nyond legal status to express a broader ethical conception of engagement in community and \\ncontribution to the greater good.\\nSeveral scholars have argued that constitution-\\nal democracy in the United States experienced \\na “second founding” in the years immediately \\nfollowing the Civil War with the adoption of \\nthe Reconstruction amendments to the Con-\\nstitution that abolished slavery, guaranteed \\nequal protection of the laws, and made black \\nmale citizens eligible to vote. The civil rights \\nmovement is, in turn, sometimes described as \\na “third founding. ” We on this Commission \\nbelieve that the profoundly challenging con-\\nditions of the twenty-first century pose an ur -\\ngent threat to the future of our democratic way \\nof life and thus require a “fourth founding”: \\nrooted not only in the language of our Con-\\nstitution and laws, but also in our expanded \\nnational creed of liberty and justice for all; not \\nonly in the actions of government, but also in \\nthe commitments of citizens; not only in the \\nreinvention of federal structures, but also in \\ndevolution of power to local governance; not \\nonly in research and analysis, but also in love \\nof country and one another.\\nWe have identified six imperatives at the heart \\nof this fourth founding: 1) to achieve equality \\nof voice and representation through our po-\\nlitical institutions; 2) to empower voters in a \\nlasting way; 3) to ensure the responsiveness of \\nour political institutions; 4) to dramatically ex-\\npand the capacity of civil society organizations \\nthat foster “bridging” across lines of difference; \\n5) to build civic information architecture that \\nsupports common purpose; and 6) to inspire \\na culture of commitment to American consti-\\ntutional democracy and one another. \\nThese imperatives produce strategies for ac-\\ntion. Below we detail those strategies and \\nthe specific recommendations to implement \\nREINVENTING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY  3', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

They also \\nreflect the interplay between national leader -\\nship and locally driven reform and between \\nindividual liberty and collective action. Final-\\nly, these strategies provide a framework for \\nensuring the resilience of our constitutional \\ndemocracy, even in the face of crisis.\\nThe Commission on the Practice of Demo-\\ncratic Citizenship is a two-year project of the \\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. Its \\nmembership comprises thirty-five dynamic \\nand thoughtful members: scholars, practi-\\ntioners, business leaders, and civic catalysts \\nwho cross geographic, demographic, and ideo-\\nlogical boundaries. Danielle Allen of Harvard \\nUniversity, Stephen Heintz of the Rockefeller \\nBrothers Fund, and Eric Liu of Citizen Uni-\\nversity serve as cochairs of the Commission. \\nOver the last two years, the Commission has \\nfocused on the interaction in the United States \\nspecifically of political institutions and civic \\nculture, on their nourishment by civil society, \\nand on the individual practice of democratic \\ncitizenship. We consistently sought to activate \\nthe adaptability of our institutions and culture \\nto equip ourselves to meet the hard challeng-\\nes of our day, but we did not, as we worked, anticipate a near-term challenge as difficult as \\nthat presented by the novel infectious disease \\nCOVID -19. In the final stage of writing this re-\\nport, we paused to reflect on its meaning for \\nour work and came to the conclusion that it left \\nour fundamental principles and recommenda-\\ntions unchanged. A constitutional democracy \\ncan meet challenges, even on this scale, pro-\\nvided that it maintains the health that gives \\nit flexibility and agility. The form of health \\nneeded by a constitutional democracy, even in \\ntimes of crisis, flows from exactly the areas of \\nfocus in this report: equality of voice and rep-\\nresentation, empowerment of voters, respon-\\nsiveness of political institutions, bridging ties \\nacross lines of difference, civic information \\narchitecture that supports common purpose, \\nand a culture of commitment to American \\nconstitutional democracy and one another. \\nThrough our work, we explored the factors \\nthat encourage and discourage people from \\nbecoming engaged in their communities; we \\nshed light on the mechanisms that help peo-\\nple connect across demographic and ideo-\\nlogical boundaries, and identified spaces that \\npromote such interaction; and we examined \\nhow the changes in our media environment \\nhave altered what civic engagement and free INTRODUCTION\\nA healthy constitutional democracy depends on a virtu-\\nous cycle in which responsive political institutions foster \\na healthy civic culture of participation and responsibility, \\nwhile a healthy civic culture—a combination of values, \\nnorms, and narratives—keeps our political institutions \\nresponsive and inclusive.\\n4 OUR COMMON PURPOSE', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

In \\norder to develop recommendations and re-\\nflect the diversity of conditions and concerns \\nin our nation, we conducted a comprehensive \\nreview of previous reform recommendations, \\nwe brought together and interviewed thought \\nleaders, and, perhaps most formatively, we held \\nnearly fifty deep listening sessions with Ameri-\\ncans in diverse communities around the coun-\\ntry: among them, first-year students of a mili-\\ntary academy, self-identified conservatives and \\nprogressives, faith leaders, rural civic leaders, \\nurban activists, and immigrants and refugees \\nfrom around the world. (Appendix B lists these \\nsessions.) Through this multipronged engage-\\nment process, we identified common barriers \\nto civic participation as well as success stories \\nof democratic engagement, and illuminated a \\npossible path of reinvention. Many of our rec-\\nommendations will be familiar, and the work \\nof this Commission has benefited greatly from \\nthe hard work and hard-earned expertise of \\nothers who generously shared their experience, \\ninsights, and suggestions. Our innovation, we \\nhope, lies in how we have combined these ideas \\nand insights into a coherent vision for demo-\\ncratic reinvention.\\nThis report contains four sections: First, we \\nsummarize the six strategies and thirty-one \\nrecommendations proposed by the Commis-\\nsion. Second, we step back to assess the crisis \\nof democratic citizenship today. Third, we of-\\nfer a case for reinvention, explain the theory of \\naction behind each of our strategies, and offer \\nmore detail on our recommendations. Finally, \\nwe conclude with a call to action for Ameri-\\ncans in multiple sectors and describe how ev-\\nery one of us can take on the task of fulfilling \\nthe promise of our constitutional democracy. \\nThroughout, we weave in the voices of Amer -\\nicans who participated in our nationwide lis-\\ntening sessions.Reaching consensus on this package  of rec -\\nommendations was not without challenges. \\nSeveral members of the Commission do not \\npersonally support one or another of the indi -\\nvidual  recommendations, yet they were will-\\ning to relinquish those reservations in support \\nof the potential benefits of the package taken \\nas a whole. In short, we compromised; we \\nsought to restore that faded art. The members \\nof the Commission were ultimately inspired \\nby the model set by Benjamin Franklin at the \\nConstitutional Convention. As he cast his vote \\nin favor of that imperfect instrument, Frank-\\nlin reminded his colleagues of their lasting \\nobligation:\\nThus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution be-\\ncause I expect no better, and because I am \\nnot sure that it is not the best. The opinions I \\nhave had of its errors, I sacrifice to the pub-\\nlic good. I have never whispered a syllable of \\nthem abroad. Within these walls they were \\nborn, and here they shall die. If every one of \\nus in returning to our Constituents were to \\nreport the objections he has had to it, and \\nendeavor to gain partizans in support of \\nthem, we might prevent its being generally \\nreceived, and thereby lose all the salutary \\neffects and great advantages resulting nat-\\nurally in our favor among foreign Nations \\nas well as among ourselves, from our real or \\napparent unanimity.\\nWe on this Commission offer our report in \\nthe same spirit: a spirit of humility and higher \\nresponsibility for an American constitutional \\ndemocracy fully worthy of our mutual com-\\nmitment to it and to one another. We hope to \\ninspire significant progress on all our recom-\\nmendations by 2026, the 250th anniversary of \\nthe nation’s birth, and in our small way, to help \\nspeed and secure the fourth founding of the \\nUnited States of America.\\nREINVENTING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY  5', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

These factors are the result of many forces, some of them entirely \\nlocal in nature, while others are global and systemic. The major stressors of the \\ntwenty-first century—a fragmented media environment, profound demographic \\nshifts, artificial intelligence and other technological advances, economic inequali-\\nty, centralized power, and climate change—require a fundamental reassessment of \\nU.S. political institutions, civil society ecosystems, and civic norms.

According to the Pew \\nResearch Center, only 17 percent of Americans \\nin 2019 said they can trust the federal govern-\\nment to do what is right “just about always” \\n(3 percent) or “most of the time” (14 percent).3 \\nTwenty years ago, more than twice as many \\nAmericans trusted the American government \\nalways or most of the time (40 percent). The \\nfederal government is not the only institution \\nthat has seen its level of trust drop over the past \\nthirty years.

While a \\nsignificant majority of Americans trust their neighbors to report serious problems to the \\nauthorities (75 percent), to obey the law (73 \\npercent), and to help those who are in need \\n(69 percent), we have far less trust in one an-\\nother when issues of politics come into play.5 \\nAs recently as 2007, a majority of Americans \\ntrusted in the political wisdom of their fel-\\nlow Americans. But, since at least 2015, that \\nconfidence has turned to skepticism, and to-\\nday, 59 percent of Americans have little or no \\nconfidence in the wisdom of the American \\npeople when it comes to making political \\ndecisions.6 Levels of personal trust in both \\ninstitutions and neighbors increase with age, \\neducation, and income and are also higher \\nwith white than with Hispanic or African \\nAmericans.7\\nY et the data also show that Americans do not \\naccept this state of affairs.

On the other hand, there is a sense of \\nhopefulness that this situation can be changed, \\nthat our problems are not intractable, and that \\nby working together in communities we can \\nrebuild the shared trust and trustworthiness \\nthat are necessary to the healthy functioning \\nof a constitutional democracy. \\nThe COVID -19 pandemic brought many of \\nthe challenges we examine below into clear \\nfocus: social and economic inequality, dis-\\ntortions in representation, weak and poorly \\nfunctioning institutions, and the disruptive \\ninformation environment all limited our so-\\nciety’s capacity to respond to the crisis quick-\\nly and effectively. At the same time, even \\nas government faltered, citizens across the \\ncountry responded with selfless generosity, a \\nspirit of mutual aid, a willingness to sacrifice \\nfor the common good, as well as unbounded \\nbottom-up creativity and initiative. This ex-\\nperience underscores the need for an essen-\\ntial reinvention of American democracy—as \\nwell as the civic wealth that exists in a pop-\\nulace that is able to organize for action and \\nwilling to nurture bonds of community and \\nlove of country.\\nThe recommendations we present here have \\nbeen developed to address the urgent priori-\\nties we identified during nearly two years of \\ninquiry. ECONOMIC INEQUALITY:  \\nA CENTRAL CONTEXTUAL F ACTOR\\nEconomic conditions powerfully shape the \\ncontext for conversations about civic partici-\\npation, government, media, and trust. Histor -\\nically high inequality in the United States not \\nonly gives some people a far louder voice than \\nothers in our political conversation, it also \\nkeeps some people from participating in dem-\\nocratic processes at all. In many of the listen-\\ning sessions that the Commission held, partic-\\nipants talked about the impossibility of taking \\nthe time to attend city council meetings or \\nvote in primary or general elections when they \\nwork multiple jobs while also caring for chil-\\ndren and other family members. Family in-\\ncomes of most Americans have been relatively \\nstagnant for the past twenty-five years. From \\n1993 to 2017, the average real family incomes of \\nthe bottom 99 percent of the U.S. population \\ngrew by only 15.5 percent, while the incomes \\nof the top 1 percent of American families grew \\nby 95.5 percent.9 Prior to the economic crash \\nsparked by the COVID -19 pandemic, U.S. eco-\\nnomic inequality was more extreme than at \\nany time since 1929. This historic upward con-\\ncentration of income and wealth in the Unit-\\ned States has been both a cause and effect of \\npolitical disengagement. Congressional prior -\\nities, studies have shown, now align with the \\npreferences of the most affluent.10 Lower- and \\nmiddle-income Americans correctly sense \\nthat the wishes of the wealthy are likely to \\nprevail and they disengage in response. Their \\ncynicism becomes self-fulfilling, empowering \\nthe affluent in a vicious circle. \\nThe real and perceived influence of large do-\\nnors on political campaigns is another issue \\nthat frequently arose in the listening sessions. \\nThe combined cost of the 2016 presidential \\nand congressional elections in the United \\nStates has been estimated at $6.3 billion (this \\n12 OUR COMMON PURPOSE', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

This indicates an erosion of \\nthe legitimacy of our institutions.

From \\nthe influence of large donors in political cam-\\npaigns to gerrymandering to the Electoral \\nCollege to the role of the media, Americans \\nacross the United States said that political pro-\\ncesses often seem designed to disenfranchise \\nthem. Those on the left and right placed dif-\\nferent emphases on the causes of a sense of \\ndisfranchisement, but the concern was widely \\nshared. Americans also broadly agreed that \\nlocal government had much more of an im-\\npact on their everyday lives.

The institutions of our \\ncivil society bind our communities together. \\nLibraries, houses of worship, parks, businesses, \\nsports teams, fan clubs, philanthropic organiza-\\ntions, colleges and universities, museums, and \\nperformance spaces: all these institutions and \\nmore offer people ways to be involved in the \\nlives of their communities that do not involve \\nvoting or attending public hearings or watch-\\ning debates.

Fifty-one percent of U.S. respondents described them-\\nselves as “dissatisfied” with how American de-\\nmocracy is working, and 46 percent said they \\nwere open to forms of government other than \\nrepresentative democracy, including rule by \\na strong leader or by groups of experts. This \\ntendency was more pronounced among peo-\\nple aged eighteen to twenty-nine than among \\nthose over age fifty.24 In the context of fear and \\nanxiety generated by COVID -19, it is all the \\nmore important that constitutional democra-\\ncy rise to the challenges before us. \\nTo commit ourselves to constitutional de-\\nmocracy, we must first commit ourselves \\nto—and have faith in—our fellow citizens. \\nTo those citizens we heard from, this faith \\nseems to flicker alive in moments of com-\\nmunal tragedy. In Calabasas, California, a \\nregion recovering from a tragic fire season, \\none municipal official described the impact \\nof the fires on the feeling of shared purpose \\nwithin the community: “I had a guy on my \\nstreet who put houses out and stayed behind \\nwhen there were no fire trucks, saved us all. \\nAnd you had a lot of people stepping up to \\nvolunteer and people getting to know their \\nneighbors for the first time. There was kind of \\na civic awakening. . . . That we are all, because \\nof tragedy, responsible with each other. So I \\nfeel a new connectedness. I hope that stays. \\nI don’t know. ” Many expressed a worry that, \\nbeyond sporting events and communal re-\\nsponses to tragedies, Americans have no ex-\\nperiences that give them a sense of common \\npurpose. They also noted—and lamented—\\nhow few opportunities Americans have today \\nto work together to improve their commu-\\nnities and build trust across boundaries.

The conditions described in this \\nreport—strained institutions, fragmented civil society, economic in-\\nequality, unequal representation, a changed media ecosystem, coars-\\nening civic culture—affect everyone in America. To overcome these democratic \\ndeficits, we need to understand citizenship both as a matter of formal rights, such \\nas voting and running for office, and also in broad, ethical terms that demand en-\\ngagement from all who reside in the United States, whatever their legal citizenship \\nstatus may be. A broad ethical definition of citizenship focuses on participation in \\ncommon life, contributions to the common good, and efforts to serve common in-\\nterests. When an individual makes such positive contributions to a self-governing \\nsociety, that person is often regarded as “a good citizen. ”\\nIt used to be that only propertied white men \\nenjoyed the entitlements of legal citizenship, \\nbut thanks to the progress of justice through \\nour courts, to clashes in our town halls and leg-\\nislatures, and to epic battles on our soil, those \\nentitlements have been expanded, if still imper -\\nfectly, to women, to descendants of people once \\nenslaved and members of indigenous commu-\\nnities once subject to destruction, and to im-\\nmigrants once foreclosed from a path to legal \\nstatus. Changes in formal citizenship have often \\nresulted from ethical practices of citizenship \\nfrom those without full access to formal polit-\\nical rights. This country’s active, contributory \\ncitizens have always included people without \\nthe formal status of “citizen. ” Consequently, the \\nCommission has focused on advancing both the \\nformal and the ethical practice of citizenship.\\nBecause these challenges are inherently inter -\\ntwined, the Commission’s recommendations seek to renew the practice of democratic cit-\\nizenship through reforms to three fundamen-\\ntal spheres of democratic life: political insti-\\ntutions and processes, civic culture, and civil \\nsociety organizations and activities. While the \\nUnited States has seen various efforts at re-\\nform over the past decade, most have focused \\non only one component of this dynamic eco-\\nsystem, whether on reforms to political insti-\\ntutions or wholly on civil society. Few of these \\nefforts have directly addressed culture or val-\\nues. Moreover, many proposals have focused \\non boosting the supply of civic organizations \\nand experiences without attending to the rea-\\nsons why demand for such experiences and \\norganizations has waned. \\nIn our recommendations, we have identified \\na set of key reforms to political institutions \\nand processes that we feel can do the most to \\nachieve integrity of representation and equal- \\n20 OUR COMMON PURPOSE', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

We see civil \\nsociety as the vital bridge between political in-\\nstitutions and that civic faith, and so in several \\nof our recommendations, we have focused on \\nhow it can better connect these two domains. \\nThe virtuous cycle of culture, institutions, and \\ncivil society has by definition no start point \\nand no end point.

Requiring a majority outcome through \\nrun-off elections seeks to avoid or mitigate \\nthese pressures, but run-off elections are cost-\\nly and participation is generally low. \\nThere is an alternative: ranked-choice voting \\n(RCV ). Instead of choosing only one candi-\\ndate, voters choose their preferred candidate \\nand then rank their second choice, their third \\nchoice, and so on. After votes are tallied, the \\nleast popular candidate is removed, and that \\ncandidate’s supporters’ votes are allocated to \\ntheir second choices.

Y et in its decision, the \\nCourt did leave one avenue for reform open: \\nthe use of strong disclosure laws to make dark \\nmoney less dark. While disclosure does not \\nstanch the flow of money, there is evidence \\nthat it deters some funding and mitigates the \\nimpact of other special-interest spending.

So \\nfar, the results are promising: a 2017 report es-\\ntimated that 84 percent of democracy-voucher  \\ndonors in Seattle had never contributed to a \\npolitical campaign before.34 \\nY et another option is the public financing of \\ncampaigns. Today, fourteen states provide \\ncandidates with some form of some public \\nfinancing, and some—Arizona and Maine \\namong them—go so far as to offer full fund-\\ning.35 Typically, in order to receive public fi-\\nnancing, a candidate must commit not to \\naccept large amounts of money from single \\ngroups or individuals.

By 2026, a tax structure in this space \\nshould be well-established, and funds should \\nbe allocated to support local journalism pro-\\nviders, other public-platform experiments, and \\ngrowth in a new field of civic media.\\n5.3  To supplement experiments \\nwith public media platforms \\n(Recommendation 5.2), establish a \\npublic-interest mandate for for-profit \\nsocial media platforms.

       " Document(page_content='APPENDIX A:  KEY TERMS\\nTo guide the work of the Commission, we have agreed to the following defini-\\ntions of key terms:\\nDEMOCRACY \\nIn the twenty-first century, democracy  refers to \\na political system in which legislative and chief \\nexecutive decision-makers are elected by ma-\\njority or plurality rule by eligible voters, with \\na presumption that the franchise approaches \\nuniversal adult suffrage among legal citizens \\nand that minority-protecting mechanisms are \\nalso in place. This definition refers to represen-\\ntative rather than direct democracy, reflecting \\nthat all existing democratic societies are rep-\\nresentative. While we use both constitutional \\ndemocracy  and democracy  in this report, we \\nrecognize these as synonyms to other terms \\nin common usage in the United States, in-\\ncluding “republic” and “democratic republic. ” \\nIn traditions of American political thought, \\nall these terms capture forms of rights-based \\nrepresentative government in which 1) elected \\ngovernment leadership is constrained by con-\\nstitutionalism, the rule of law, the separation \\nof powers, the free expression of the people, \\nand the legal protection and moral affirmation \\nof the rights of individuals; and 2) groups and \\nparties that are not part of electoral majorities \\ncannot easily be disenfranchised or suffer loss \\nof rights of association, voice, and legal protec-\\ntion by the electorally determined leadership. \\nCITIZENSHIP\\nCitizenship can be understood broadly in two \\nways. One is a formal status within a state that \\naffords political participation, including the \\nvote, and implies certain obligations of engage-\\nment or participation in state activities. Over \\nthe course of U.S. history, the formal status of citizen has sometimes attached to membership \\nin particular cities, sometimes to states, and \\nsometimes to the nation as a whole; the differ -\\nent categories of formal membership have not \\nalways aligned. The second, broader concep-\\ntion of citizenship is an ethical notion of be-\\ning a prosocial contributor to a self-governing  \\ncommunity. This notion pertains regardless \\nof legal documentation status. It centers on \\nparticipation in common life, contribution to \\nthe common good, and a spirit of obligation \\nto interests greater than one’s own. The collo-\\nquialism “a good citizen” captures this mean-\\ning. The work of the Commission is intend-\\ned to include the first way of thinking about \\ncitizenship and extend to the second. This is \\ncontested territory. Not everyone thinks that \\nthe ethical category of citizenship should ap-\\nply to those who do not have the formal sta-\\ntus of citizens. In our work, however, we take \\nthe fact that anyone can  contribute positively \\nto their community as foundational to the de-\\nvelopment of all formal institutions of citizen-\\nship. We protect the idea of self-government \\nfor free and equal citizens by cultivating the \\nvalues and practices of self-government in all \\nmembers of a community. \\nPARTICIPA TION AND ENGAGEMENT\\nWe believe there is a spectrum of citizen par -\\nticipation and engagement that stretches from \\nsocial to civic to political, in any order. First, \\nwe offer the following definitions:\\nSOCIAL PARTICIPA TION:  Any activity that \\nis mainly driven by the desire to work or \\nREINVENTING AMERICAN DEMOCRACY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY  65', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 72}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='socialize with members of an affinity group \\n(whether defined by geography, identity, faith, \\nclub membership, Facebook group participa-\\ntion, and so on) or a more loosely knit com-\\nmunity in common enjoyment of shared in-\\nterests (such as a gardening or book club).\\nCIVIC ENGAGEMENT:  Any activity that in-\\nvolves or is intended to affect not only the in-\\nterests or work of a particular group of faith \\nor affinity but those of a broader community \\n(whether defined locally, nationally, or glob-\\nally). Take as examples a gardening club that \\nis working through civil society partnerships \\nto eliminate food deserts, a book club that \\nencourages members to do volunteer work \\non an issue they are reading about, a place of \\nworship whose members collaborate to serve \\nmeals to the homeless, or a Facebook group \\nthat decides to advocate for the sale of fair \\ntrade chocolate in movie theaters.\\nPOLITICAL PARTICIPA TION:  Any activity \\nor set of activities driven by a desire to in-\\nfluence government, policy-making, and/or \\nelections, such as participating in a protest, \\njoining a party, volunteering in a campaign, \\nrunning for office, testifying at public hear -\\nings, or advocating on public issues through \\nsocial media. More specific examples include \\na gardening club that lobbies its city council \\nfor new rules to promote community gardens; \\na book club that organizes neighbors to sup-\\nport a public library levy; a place of worship \\nwhose members join in local organizing to \\nchange housing ordinances or policies around \\nabortion provision; or a Facebook group that \\ncoordinates to call and write to legislators on \\nbehalf of a specific policy outcome.Second, while civic and political engagement \\ncan be undertaken by an individual acting \\nalone, all forms of engagement ultimately \\nhave a collective aspect: success requires get-\\nting others to join in the activity, or participat-\\ning alongside others yourself. Even the hermit \\nwho goes to vote without speaking to anyone \\nelse has her votes counted alongside those of \\nmany others.\\nThird, and crucially, we note that it is often \\ndifficult to assess whether a given form of col-\\nlective action is purely social or civic or po-\\nlitical. Democratic practice is never this neat. \\nMoreover, any participant can cycle through \\nthese activity types in any particular order: \\nthey form a variegated continuum of expe-\\nrience, not a ladder. Nor is the mere fact of \\nparticipation in social life a guarantee that \\nthe engagement will be prosocial: the history \\nof the Ku Klux Klan shows the power of as-\\nsociationalism deployed toward unacceptable \\ngoals. Nonetheless, this conceptual framework \\nsharpens our thinking so that we can more \\nclearly articulate to the public our theory of \\naction and recommendations.\\nDEMOCRA TIC ENGAGEMENT:  A broad term \\nthat encompasses both the activities associat-\\ned with civic engagement and political par -\\nticipation and the attitudes and beliefs indi-\\nviduals express about the actors, institutions, \\norganizations, and policies active within those \\ntwo spheres.APPENDIX A: KEY TERMS\\n66 OUR COMMON PURPOSE', metadata={'source': '2020-Democratic-Citizenship_Our-Common-Purpose.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='APPENDIX B:  DESCRIPTION OF \\nLISTENING SESSIONS\\nIn order to develop its recommendations, the Commission conducted nearly fif-\\nty listening sessions around the United States. The intent of this strategy was not \\nto collect a statistically representative sample, but to cast a wide net and surface \\nthe personal experiences, frustrations, and acts of engagement of a diverse array \\nof Americans. Through the listening sessions, the Commission generated valuable \\ninsights into what factors either discourage or promote democratic engagement. \\nMost of the listening sessions were held from Jan-\\nuary to June 2019. In organizing these listening \\nsessions, the Commission relied on the gener -\\nosity and support of many individuals and their \\norganizations.

      "a report of the American Academy’s Commission on the Practice of \n",
      "Democratic Citizenship, comes at a pivotal moment in the history of the \n",
      "American experiment. \n",
      "As this report goes to press, our nation, already challenged by shifting political, economic, and \n",
      "social forces, is also in the early days of a serious public health and economic crisis. While it is \n",
      "impossible to predict today how the COVID -19 epidemic will impact the fabric of the United States \n",
      "and the world, the work done by the Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship does \n",
      "allow one confident prediction: Americans will respond to the current challenge and its aftereffects \n",
      "with creative acts of generosity and innovative solutions borne of the recognition that we are all in \n",
      "this together. In the pages that follow, you will find this spirit expressed in Americans’ own words. \n",
      "Never before has the work of the Academy reflected the voices and experiences of such a broad and \n",
      "diverse group of Americans. In 2019, the Commission conducted forty-seven listening sessions in \n",
      "cities and towns around the country and solicited the stories and experiences with the democratic \n",
      "process of hundreds of Americans from different demographic and political backgrounds (for a full \n",
      "list, see Appendix B). Their wisdom and commitment not only inspired the Commission’s final rec-\n",
      "ommendations but also demonstrate the potential for what the United States can become when all \n",
      "of its citizens are actively engaged in the civic and political life of their communities and the nation.\n",
      "Throughout our country’s history, the American people have confronted moments of crisis with \n",
      "resilience and an openness to reinvention, enabling our nation to become a better version of it-\n",
      "self. Even before the COVID -19 pandemic, the members of this Commission recognized that we \n",
      "found ourselves at a similar crossroads. The recommendations in this report touch all sectors of \n",
      "American life and offer a bold path that will require all of us to commit to reinventing aspects of \n",
      "our constitutional democracy. The realities of a disruptive media and information environment, \n",
      "outdated political institutions, economic and social inequality, and hyperpartisan political lead-\n",
      "ership have laid bare the urgency of this imperative. The Commission challenges us to achieve \n",
      "significant progress toward its recommendations by 2026, our nation’s 250th anniversary. \n",
      "The Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship was established in the spring of \n",
      "2018 at the initiative of then Academy President Jonathan Fanton and Stephen D. Bechtel, Jr., \n",
      "Chair of the S. D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation. Mr. Bechtel challenged the Academy to consider what \n",
      "it means to be a good citizen in the twenty-first century, and to ask how all of us might obtain \n",
      "the values, knowledge, and skills to become still better citizens. Since 1780, projects that work \n",
      "to bolster American citizens’ understanding of and engagement with the institutions of their \n",
      "government have been a hallmark of the Academy’s work. Our charter states that the Arts and \n",
      "Sciences “promote the honor and dignity of the government which patronizes them, ” and that the \n",

      "to advance the interest, honor, dignity, and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous peo-\n",
