      "a report of the American Academy’s Commission on the Practice of \n",
      "Democratic Citizenship, comes at a pivotal moment in the history of the \n",
      "American experiment. \n",
      "As this report goes to press, our nation, already challenged by shifting political, economic, and \n",
      "social forces, is also in the early days of a serious public health and economic crisis. While it is \n",
      "impossible to predict today how the COVID -19 epidemic will impact the fabric of the United States \n",
      "and the world, the work done by the Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship does \n",
      "allow one confident prediction: Americans will respond to the current challenge and its aftereffects \n",
      "with creative acts of generosity and innovative solutions borne of the recognition that we are all in \n",
      "this together. In the pages that follow, you will find this spirit expressed in Americans’ own words. \n",
      "Never before has the work of the Academy reflected the voices and experiences of such a broad and \n",
      "diverse group of Americans. In 2019, the Commission conducted forty-seven listening sessions in \n",
      "cities and towns around the country and solicited the stories and experiences with the democratic \n",
      "process of hundreds of Americans from different demographic and political backgrounds (for a full \n",
      "list, see Appendix B). Their wisdom and commitment not only inspired the Commission’s final rec-\n",
      "ommendations but also demonstrate the potential for what the United States can become when all \n",
      "of its citizens are actively engaged in the civic and political life of their communities and the nation.\n",
      "Throughout our country’s history, the American people have confronted moments of crisis with \n",
      "resilience and an openness to reinvention, enabling our nation to become a better version of it-\n",
      "self. Even before the COVID -19 pandemic, the members of this Commission recognized that we \n",
      "found ourselves at a similar crossroads. The recommendations in this report touch all sectors of \n",
      "American life and offer a bold path that will require all of us to commit to reinventing aspects of \n",
      "our constitutional democracy. The realities of a disruptive media and information environment, \n",
      "outdated political institutions, economic and social inequality, and hyperpartisan political lead-\n",
      "ership have laid bare the urgency of this imperative. The Commission challenges us to achieve \n",
      "significant progress toward its recommendations by 2026, our nation’s 250th anniversary. \n",
      "The Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship was established in the spring of \n",
